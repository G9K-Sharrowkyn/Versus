Jiren (Dragon Ball Super) edges Saitama (One Punch Man) in raw power and speed at the start, but Saitama’s exponential growth during combat is the decisive factor.
Research across scaling wikis, fan debates, and feat analyses suggests Saitama adapts and surpasses Jiren in most standard matchups, winning roughly 6/10 times once the fight extends beyond initial clashes. Jiren’s low-multiverse feats (shaking the World of Void) give him a clear early advantage, yet Saitama’s limitless potential—demonstrated by rapidly outpacing cosmic threats—shifts momentum quickly.
Stat Overview
Both average ~86/100 across nine categories, with Jiren leading physical stats and Saitama dominating hax and stamina. This near-tie on paper highlights why the outcome hinges on fight dynamics rather than pure numbers.
Fight Flow Summary
Jiren seizes initiative with overwhelming pressure and prediction. Saitama holds back initially but grows stronger mid-battle, eventually landing decisive blows. Key turning point: Saitama’s serious punches scale exponentially, neutralizing Jiren’s edge.
Verdict Under Default Rules
Open battlefield, no prep, win by KO/death. Saitama takes the win in prolonged engagements due to growth mechanics that outpace Jiren’s fixed limits. Short blitz favors Jiren, but standard VS assumptions lean Saitama.

0. Hook
In a clash of titans from two iconic shonen universes, Jiren—the stoic Pride Trooper whose mere presence rattles infinite voids—faces Saitama, the bald hero whose “one punch” philosophy hides an ever-expanding well of limitless power. Raw cosmic might collides with narrative-bending growth: can Jiren’s disciplined supremacy crush Saitama before the latter’s exponential adaptation turns the tide? This analysis merges feats, scaling debates, and matchup dynamics into one coherent verdict.
1. Introduction and methodology
This VS writeup synthesizes data from authoritative sources including VS Battles Wiki tiering, Dragon Ball and One Punch Man official wikis, and community scaling discussions on Reddit and Comic Vine. Nine standardized categories (Strength, Speed, Durability, Combat IQ, Hax, Stamina, Fighting Style, Experience, Combat Skills) were scored 0–100 per source via feat mapping, then arithmetically averaged and rounded. Fights are treated as non-linear: statistical edges can be overturned by adaptation, hax interactions, or win-condition asymmetry. Baseline assumptions lock Jiren at his full-power Tournament of Power peak (Dragon Ball Super anime/manga) and Saitama at his current manga iteration (post-Garou cosmic fight, including exponential growth and time-travel capability).
2. Character introduction
2.1 Character A: Jiren (DBS)
Jiren is the strongest mortal of Universe 11, a Pride Trooper whose self-taught ki mastery surpasses Gods of Destruction. His defensive, analytical style emphasizes overwhelming power and prediction, fueled by trauma-driven conviction. Strongest edges: low-multiverse physicals, time-skip resistance, and aura barriers that repel planetary threats.
2.2 Character B: Saitama (OPM)
Saitama is the Caped Baldy, a hero who broke his limiter through extreme training, granting indefinite exponential growth. His casual brawling style belies perfect technique mimicry and gag-level willpower. Strongest edges: limitless physical escalation mid-fight, matter/antimatter manipulation for time travel, and resistances to extreme cosmic conditions.
3. Averaged stats table

Category Jiren (DBS) / Saitama (OPM)
Strength 94/88
Speed 93/87
Durability 94/88
Combat IQ 87/72
Hax 50/96
Stamina 90/99
Fighting Style 91/78
Experience 87/78
Combat Skills 92/85
Overall Average 86/86
On-paper the fighters are dead even, but category splits reveal Jiren’s physical dominance versus Saitama’s hax-driven adaptability. Exact averages: Jiren 86.44, Saitama 85.67 (rounded).

4. Origin and profile
Jiren’s philosophy centers on absolute strength as redemption from childhood loss; he fights defensively, analyzing foes before striking with minimal effort. Saitama’s core drive is boredom from effortless victories, leading to casual restraint and emotional surges that accelerate growth. Jiren’s disciplined mentality clashes with Saitama’s instinctive, ever-evolving approach—creating a dynamic where Jiren seeks decisive dominance while Saitama inadvertently escalates until the opponent matches his interest.
5. Powers and weaknesses
Jiren’s tools: Ki manipulation for massive shockwaves, invisible forcefields, dimensional rift creation, rage-fueled power spikes, and analytical prediction that counters time hax. Vulnerabilities: emotional triggers can delay full power; pride limits teamwork synergy.
Saitama’s tools: Exponential physical growth (multiplies strength/speed/durability rapidly under emotion), technique mimicry, sub-atomic time travel, non-physical interaction, and extreme environmental resistances. Vulnerabilities: initial holding back prolongs fights; lacks proactive killing intent.
Highest-impact swing factor: Saitama’s growth rate—shown to outpace cosmic mimicry in minutes—directly counters Jiren’s fixed ceiling, turning early pressure into inevitable reversal.
6. Feats - quick review

7. Complete defeated/neutralized list
Jiren: Hit (broke time prison), Kale (Legendary Super Saiyan one-shot), Maji Kayo (shockwave KO), Toppo (implied superiority), pushed Perfected UI Goku, SSBKx20 Goku, Vegeta (multiple forms), Golden Frieza, Android 17 simultaneously.
Saitama: Boros (serious punch), Awakened Cosmic Fear Garou (surpassed and defeated), Orochi, Elder Centipede, countless Dragon-level monsters, Phoenix Man (mental space breach), Geryuganshoop (telekinesis resistance).
8. Hypothetical fight - step by step
8.1 Opening
Jiren seizes tempo immediately with superior speed and ki sensing, closing distance via Infinity Rush barrages while erecting aura barriers. Saitama starts casual, dodging or tanking early hits with minimal effort, but Jiren’s analytical prediction and shockwaves force Saitama to engage seriously within seconds. Initiative and distance control firmly with Jiren.
8.2 Mid-fight
Adaptation becomes paramount: Jiren’s pressure drains nothing from Saitama while emotional surges trigger exponential growth. Stamina and growth loops favor Saitama as Jiren’s fixed power output meets increasingly stronger counters. Tactical reads shift—Saitama mimics Garou-level techniques while Jiren’s rage power spikes prove insufficient against escalating durability.
8.3 Turning points

Trigger: Jiren’s Power Impact barrage (beneficiary: Jiren) — Saitama tanks and grows noticeably stronger, flipping damage output (impact: Jiren forced defensive).
Trigger: Saitama sneeze-level breath attack or serious punch (beneficiary: Saitama) — erases arena sections and scales past Jiren’s aura (impact: Jiren takes first real damage).
Trigger: Jiren attempts time-skip resistance (beneficiary: Saitama) — growth allows particle-level time manipulation counter (impact: timeline pressure neutralized).
Trigger: Prolonged exchange fatigue (beneficiary: Saitama) — limitless stamina + exponential curve overwhelms Jiren’s limits (impact: decisive KO).

8.4 Source verdict evidence distribution

VS Battles Wiki scaling (derived, high confidence): Jiren 8/10 via low-multiverse tier and speed blitz before growth activates.
Comic Vine debate threads (derived, medium confidence): Saitama slight edge ~5.5-6/10 citing star-erasing punches and growth outscaling fixed ceilings.
PowerScaling Reddit consensus (derived, medium confidence): Saitama 6.5/10 in standard prolonged fights due to exponential adaptation documented against Garou.
Synthesis: Verdicts spread across raw-stats dominance (Jiren) versus growth asymmetry (Saitama); slight overall lean toward Saitama once hax engages, with no single explicit source score dominating.

9. Minority perspective
N/A: no materially distinct minority interpretation found beyond standard split (raw power vs growth); all credible analyses acknowledge both sides’ arguments without outlier cosmology claims altering core dynamics.
10. Base verdict (always)
Saitama wins 6/10. Under default open-space, no-prep, standard VS rules, Jiren dominates the first minute with overwhelming physicals and prediction, but Saitama’s documented exponential growth (rapidly surpassing cosmic mimicry) activates mid-fight, allowing him to match and exceed Jiren’s output before limits are reached. Jiren’s fixed scaling cannot keep pace with limitless escalation.
11. Conditional verdict
Scenario 1: Quick-fight assumption (<1 minute, Jiren blitzes before growth ramps) — Jiren favored 8/10. Reasoning: Superior starting speed and AP one-shots or KO’s before Saitama’s emotional surge triggers meaningful scaling.
Scenario 2: Standard prolonged engagement (full abilities, no time limit) — Saitama favored 7/10. Reasoning: Growth documented to multiply stats exponentially within minutes (Garou fight precedent) outstrips Jiren’s ceiling, turning early pressure into decisive reversal.
12. Why stats and final verdict can diverge
N/A: linear profile and practical result align once hax category (Saitama’s growth) is properly weighted against fixed physical stats.
13. Closing
Saitama emerges the victor in the majority of analyzed scenarios thanks to his core narrative mechanic of boundless improvement, though Jiren’s disciplined cosmic power makes any short fight extremely dangerous. Overall confidence is medium-high given consistent feat mapping across sources; the sole condition that flips the outcome is an ultra-brief encounter preventing Saitama’s growth activation. This matchup beautifully illustrates how non-linear hax can trump raw statistical superiority.
