## 0. Hook

This matchup presents a definitive clash of combat philosophies: the pinnacle of established power versus the embodiment of limitless potential. Jiren, a mortal whose might surpasses gods and can shake an infinite realm, represents a static, overwhelming force. He is pitted against Saitama, a hero whose core ability is non-linear, exponential growth, allowing him to overcome any challenge by simply becoming stronger. This fight forces a confrontation between a seemingly insurmountable wall and a force that knows no ceiling [hook[0]][1] [hook[4]][2].

## 1. Introduction and methodology

This VS analysis synthesizes data from a wide range of reputable community sources, including VS Battles Wiki, Reddit forums like r/whowouldwin and r/PowerScaling, and other dedicated analytical threads, with all information current as of February 2026. A multi-step estimation pipeline was used to normalize qualitative feats into quantitative scores by extracting evidence, mapping it to established power tiers, and calibrating scores. The comparison is structured across nine core combat categories: Strength, Speed, Durability, Combat IQ, Hax, Stamina, Fighting Style, Experience, and Combat Skills. It is crucial to note that combat outcomes are not always linear; factors like exponential growth, hard counters, and win-condition asymmetry can cause the practical result to diverge from a simple comparison of baseline statistics [introduction_and_methodology[0]][3].

## 2. Character introduction

### 2.1 Character A: Jiren (Dragon Ball Super)
Jiren is the strongest member of the Pride Troopers from Universe 11 and the most powerful antagonist in the Tournament of Power. A mortal whose power is stated to exceed that of a God of Destruction, his immense strength is born from a tragic past, leading him to a solitary philosophy where absolute strength is the only true justice [character_a_introduction.profile_summary[0]][4]. His combat style is the epitome of efficiency; he often remains motionless, using minimal movements and subtle glares (Invisible Eye Blasts) to neutralize threats. When he does engage, his style is direct, precise, and devastating, utilizing a "Relaxed State" to conserve energy until the moment of impact [character_a_introduction.combat_style[0]][4]. His primary edges are his staggering raw statistics (Low Multiverse level) and resistance to time manipulation [character_a_introduction.key_advantages[0]][4].

### 2.2 Character B: Saitama (One Punch Man)
Saitama is a formerly ordinary human who broke his "limiter" through intense training, achieving immeasurable power. Now a "hero for fun," he suffers from existential boredom due to his ability to defeat any enemy with a single punch [character_b_introduction.profile_summary[0]][5]. His fighting style is best described as amateurish brawling; lacking formal martial arts training, he relies entirely on overwhelming physical statistics to win. His approach is casual and naive, often leaving him open to technical outmaneuvering early in fights [character_b_introduction.combat_style[1]][1]. His single greatest advantage is "Exponential Growth," where his power increases rapidly and infinitely when faced with a sufficient challenge, allowing him to surpass any opponent given enough time [character_b_introduction.key_advantages[1]][1].

## 3. Averaged stats table

The following table represents the averaged scores (0-100) derived from the analysis of feats and community consensus. Jiren holds a significant lead in technical combat metrics and baseline power, while Saitama's scores reflect his high-end feats and growth potential.

| Category | Jiren (DBS) | Saitama (OPM) | Advantage |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1. Strength** | 98 | 92 | Jiren |
| **2. Speed** | 97 | 88 | Jiren |
| **3. Durability** | 98 | 94 | Jiren |
| **4. Combat IQ** | 85 | 60 | Jiren |
| **5. Hax** | 75 | 95 | Saitama |
| **6. Stamina** | 90 | 100 | Saitama |
| **7. Fighting Style** | 95 | 40 | Jiren |
| **8. Experience** | 90 | 65 | Jiren |
| **9. Combat Skills** | 95 | 45 | Jiren |

**Overall Averages:**
- **Jiren:** 91.4 (Rounded: 91)
- **Saitama:** 75.4 (Rounded: 75)

**Interpretation:** On paper, Jiren dominates the statistical comparison, particularly in skill-based categories where Saitama's amateur status drags down his average. However, Saitama's perfect score in Stamina and high score in Hax (due to exponential growth) represent his path to victory: surviving the initial onslaught to outscale Jiren's static 98s.

## 4. Origin and profile

The psychological profiles of Jiren and Saitama are a study in contrasts, both forged by their relationship with absolute power. Jiren's origin is rooted in tragedy; the loss of his family and comrades instilled in him a ruthless belief that strength is the only absolute, the only thing that can prevent loss. His combat philosophy is a direct extension of this: a cold, efficient, and overwhelming application of force to prove his solitary might [origin_and_profile_comparison[1]][6].

In stark opposition, Saitama's origin is mundane, and his power is a source of existential ennui. He achieved strength not for justice or revenge, but simply as a hobby. Now, his absolute power has isolated him, robbing him of the thrill of struggle. His combat philosophy is nonchalant and unrefined; he seeks not to dominate, but to find a single opponent who can make him feel something again [origin_and_profile_comparison[0]][5]. Jiren's power is his purpose; Saitama's power has robbed him of his.

## 5. Powers and weaknesses

### Jiren (Dragon Ball Super)
**Key Tools:** Jiren possesses Low Multiverse level power, capable of shaking the infinite "World of Void" simply by powering up. His arsenal includes "Invisible Eye Blasts" (Kiai) for zoning, "Power Impact" energy spheres, and formidable "Energy Barriers" that block attacks without physical contact. Crucially, his power is so immense that it "transcends time," allowing him to break free from time-stop abilities like Hit's Time Cage [powers_and_weaknesses.key_powers[1]][4].
**Vulnerabilities:** His performance is linked to his mental state; emotional distress regarding his past can degrade his focus. While vast, his stamina is finite and can be depleted by sustained high-intensity combat.

### Saitama (One Punch Man)
**Key Tools:** Saitama exhibits Multi-Solar System to Galaxy level power, demonstrated by the "Serious Punch Squared" which destroyed countless stars. His defining ability is "Exponential Growth," allowing his power to increase infinitely when challenged. He has also demonstrated non-physical interaction (kicking hyperspace portals) and causality manipulation (Zero Punch time travel) [powers_and_weaknesses.key_powers[0]][7] [powers_and_weaknesses.key_powers[3]][1].
**Vulnerabilities:** He is an amateur brawler with no technical skill, relying solely on stats. His casual nature often leads him to tank attacks he could dodge, leaving him open to ring-outs or incapacitation techniques before he gets serious.

**Swing Factor:** The highest-impact swing factor is the **Time-to-Kill vs. Growth Rate**. Jiren has the power to end the fight immediately, but if he fails to do so, Saitama's exponential growth will eventually eclipse Jiren's static power ceiling.

## 6. Feats - quick review

### 6.1 Jiren
- **Time Transcendence:** Broke free from Hit's "Time Cage," rendering time-skip techniques ineffective solely through raw power [character_a_feats_review.source_reference[0]][8].

## 8. Hypothetical fight - step by step

### 8.1 Opening
Jiren seizes the immediate initiative. Consistent with his doctrine of efficiency, he opens with a burst of Massively FTL+ speed to close the distance, utilizing "Invisible Eye Blasts" to test Saitama's defenses [hypothetical_fight_opening[0]][4]. Saitama, true to character, likely attempts to tank the initial salvo. While his durability allows him to survive, the sheer force of Jiren's Low Multiverse-level attacks sends him flying, establishing Jiren's control over the tempo and positioning. Jiren dominates the early exchange through superior reach, speed, and technical skill.

### 8.2 Mid-fight
As the fight extends, the dynamic shifts from domination to attrition. Jiren increases his intensity, unleashing a barrage of physical strikes and "Power Impact" blasts to keep the pressure high. However, Saitama begins to adapt. Fueled by the thrill of a challenge (or frustration), his "Exponential Growth" activates [hypothetical_fight_mid_fight[0]][10]. Saitama's durability holds up against Jiren's assault, and his own counter-attacks begin to carry weight. Jiren, noticing his opponent's rising power, is forced to abandon his "Relaxed State" and expend actual stamina, while Saitama shows no signs of fatigue.

### 8.3 Turning points
1. **The Emotional Surge (Beneficiary: Saitama):** A surge of emotion triggers Saitama's growth rate to spike vertically. His power jumps from Galaxy-level to matching Jiren's Multiversal tier in moments [hypothetical_fight_turning_points.turning_point_description[0]][10].
2. **The Full Power Wall (Beneficiary: Jiren):** Jiren recognizes the threat and unleashes his full, limit-broken power immediately. He traps Saitama in a massive energy sphere intended to ring-out or vaporize him before the growth curve becomes insurmountable.
3. **The Zero Punch (Beneficiary: Saitama):** If pushed to the absolute brink, Saitama instinctively accesses the causality manipulation he learned from Garou, landing a blow that bypasses conventional durability or resets the engagement to his advantage [powers_and_weaknesses.key_powers[0]][7].

### 8.4 Source verdict evidence distribution

| Source | Winner | Type | Confidence | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ComicVine Consensus** | Jiren | explicit | high | ~75% of users argue Jiren "one-shots" due to Multiversal scaling vs. Saitama's Galaxy feats [source_verdict_distribution.rationale[0]][11]. |
| **VS Battles Wiki** | Jiren | derived | medium | Jiren is Tier 2-C (Low Multiverse); Saitama is Tier 3-A/3-C (Galaxy). Tier gap dictates winner [base_verdict.winner[0]][4]. |
| **Reddit (r/PowerScaling)** | Saitama | derived | medium | Arguments focus on "Infinite Potential" and "Gag Character" meta overriding static stats [minority_perspective[2]][12]. |

**Synthesis:** There is a strong community consensus favoring Jiren based on static tiering (Multiversal > Galaxy). The minority favoring Saitama relies heavily on interpreting his "growth" as an absolute no-limits fallacy.

## 9. Minority perspective

The strongest credible counter-position argues that Saitama would win due to his unique "Exponential Growth" ability. Proponents state that if the fight is prolonged, Saitama's power will increase infinitely, eventually surpassing Jiren's static power level regardless of the starting gap [minority_perspective[2]][12]. A secondary argument posits that Saitama is a "gag character" narratively designed to be unbeatable, rendering conventional power scaling irrelevant. However, strictly feat-based analysis places Jiren significantly higher at the start.

## 10. Base verdict

**Winner: Jiren**
**Score: 8/10**

Jiren wins the majority of encounters due to an overwhelming initial advantage in power, speed, and skill. His Low Multiverse-level attacks [base_verdict.winner[0]][4] are orders of magnitude above Saitama's demonstrated Galaxy-level durability [base_verdict.rationale[1]][13]. In a standard fight, Jiren's efficiency and ruthlessness mean he is likely to incapacitate or ring-out Saitama long before the hero's exponential growth can bridge the colossal statistical gap.

## 11. Conditional verdict

**Scenario 1: Prolonged, Challenging Fight**
- **Assumptions:** The fight lasts long enough for Saitama's growth to activate; Saitama survives the initial blitz.
- **Favored Side:** Saitama
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** If Saitama survives the opening minute, his exponential growth [conditional_verdict.assumptions[0]][12] allows him to rapidly match and eventually exceed Jiren's power. Jiren's finite stamina becomes a liability against an opponent who gets stronger every second.

**Scenario 2: Bloodlusted / Kill-On-Sight**
- **Assumptions:** Jiren fights with immediate intent to kill, using full power from the start.
- **Favored Side:** Jiren
- **Score:** 10/10
- **Reasoning:** Without the "tournament" mindset or plot-induced hesitation, Jiren's speed and AP advantage result in an instant speed-blitz execution before Saitama can throw a punch.

## 12. Why stats and final verdict can diverge

The practical result of this fight can diverge from a simple comparison of baseline stats due to Saitama's non-linear "Exponential Growth" mechanic. While Jiren's stats are higher at the outset (98 vs 92), Saitama's power is not a fixed value; it functions as a hard counter to static opponents in extended conflicts [stats_verdict_divergence[0]][14]. This creates a win-condition asymmetry: Jiren must win *now*, while Saitama only needs to *not lose* for a while.

## 13. Closing

With high confidence, Jiren is the victor in a standard, direct confrontation, as his vastly superior baseline power and speed should allow him to overwhelm Saitama before growth becomes a factor. However, the entire matchup hinges on a single key condition: the duration of the fight. If the battle is prolonged, Saitama's exponential growth becomes the single most likely factor to flip the outcome, making him the probable winner in a war of attrition [closing_statement[0]][15].
