Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Who wins the fight on paper?
- line_1: Atrocitus wins the paper fight through speed, hax, experience, and the broader control toolkit.
- line_2: Hulk wins the real fight more often because regen and rage punish every failed stop.
- line_3: This is what happens when a paper edge runs into a monster built for long wars.
- quote: Atrocitus has more answers. Hulk needs fewer.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Why better stats do not guarantee victory
- trap_top: BETTER HAX PROFILE >
- trap_bottom: CAN STILL LOSE IF RAGE FEEDS THE TARGET
- example: A smarter control fighter can still lose if every failed stop makes the other side harder to stop.
- question: Can Atrocitus keep contact from ever happening twice?

- mechanika: Atrocitus tries to weaponize rage as fuel and control. Hulk turns prolonged punishment into more strength, more gamma, and more pressure.
- implikacja: If Atrocitus keeps distance, the loop can stay in his hands. If Hulk keeps getting angrier without losing function, the loop flips hard.
- psychologia: Atrocitus wants control. Hulk wants one opening.

Template Summary:
- headline: FINAL SUMMARY
- subtitle:
- winner: Atrocitus wins the stats, Hulk wins the fight more often
- line_1: Stat average favors Atrocitus, 85.6 vs 83.9.
- line_2: Hulk still wins most versions of the fight because regen and rage escalation punish long fights.
- line_3: Atrocitus flips the fight only if distance control stays stable from start to finish.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: One comeback route against a brutal default outcome
- opening: Atrocitus opens with flight, plasma, and construct pressure while Hulk tanks the storm and closes distance.
- mid_fight: The loop gets weird fast. Rage manipulation can help Atrocitus or feed the monster he is trying to slow.
- late_fight: If Atrocitus never secures a real control win condition, Hulk's gamma pressure and physical contact take over.
- end_condition: Atrocitus needs control without feeding the monster. Hulk needs contact plus time.
