Key Points

Research suggests World Breaker Hulk holds the edge, winning roughly 7/10 times under standard random-encounter assumptions.
Atrocitus (Butcher) excels in speed, versatile rage-based hax, and experience, potentially landing early decisive strikes.
Hulk’s limitless strength growth, extreme durability, and regeneration allow him to tank initial assaults and overwhelm in extended combat—the evidence leans toward his raw power prevailing despite Atrocitus’ advantages.
The matchup is close on paper but favors Hulk practically due to non-linear rage mechanics and regen economy; no major controversy in core feats, though cross-universe scaling adds interpretive nuance.

Character Profiles
Atrocitus (Butcher) is DC’s vengeful Red Lantern leader, empowered by the Butcher rage entity for cosmic-level amplification. He blends brutal melee with ring constructs, acidic plasma, blood magic, and rage manipulation.
World Breaker Hulk is Marvel’s unleashed gamma powerhouse from the World War Hulk arc—planet-cracking strength that escalates indefinitely with anger, paired with god-tier regeneration and warrior intellect.

0. Hook
Raw cosmic rage meets gamma-fueled apocalypse: Atrocitus channeling the Butcher entity versus World Breaker Hulk’s planet-shattering fury. On paper the stats are neck-and-neck, yet non-linear combat realities—regeneration loops, infinite anger scaling, and rage-feedback asymmetry—promise a decisive edge for one combatant in this cross-universe brawl.
1. Introduction and methodology
This analysis synthesizes feats from authoritative comic sources (DC Database, VS Battles Wiki, Hulk Fandom, Comic Vine profiles, and respect-thread compilations) into one coherent narrative. Nine standardized categories (Strength, Speed, Durability, Combat IQ, Hax, Stamina, Fighting Style, Experience, Combat Skills) receive per-source numeric mapping (0-100 scale) followed by arithmetic averaging and rounding. Fights are acknowledged as non-linear; raw stats inform but do not dictate outcomes when regeneration economy, adaptive rage, or hax asymmetry intervene. All versions are locked to prompt specifications: Atrocitus as Butcher-empowered (New 52/Rebirth era entity interaction) and World Breaker Hulk (World War Hulk peak form, Earth-616).
2. Character introduction
A. Atrocitus (Butcher) (DC)
Red Lantern Corps founder and Butcher rage-entity host. Brutal, calculating avenger who retains intellect amid fury. Strongest practical edges: MFTL+ flight and combat speed, blood-magic precognition, corrosive plasma constructs, rage absorption/infection, and entity-level scaling to Spectre-tier threats.
B. World Breaker Hulk (Marvel)
Unleashed Green Scar at maximum gamma output. Warrior intellect beneath endless rage. Strongest practical edges: planetary environmental destruction via footsteps, limitless strength/durability escalation with anger, high-mid regeneration (reassembles from near-atomic damage), and gamma-radiation aura that passively threatens continents.

Overall Average 87/85
On-paper interpretation: Atrocitus leads in speed and hax categories while Hulk dominates raw physicals and endurance. The 2-point overall gap signals a close contest where practical dynamics will decide the victor.
4. Origin and profile
Atrocitus, survivor of Sector 666’s massacre, forged the Red Lanterns through blood rituals and imprisoned then later merged with the Butcher—the literal embodiment of rage—to amplify his vendetta against the Guardians. His philosophy is calculated vengeance tempered by retained sanity. World Breaker Hulk arises when Bruce Banner fully relinquishes control after Sakaar exile; the Green Scar’s warrior mind directs planet-shaking power without remorse. Both are rage incarnate, yet Atrocitus weaponizes it surgically while Hulk becomes an unstoppable natural disaster. The psychological symmetry creates potential feedback loops, but Hulk’s passive gamma escalation proves harder to disrupt.
5. Powers and weaknesses
Atrocitus (Butcher) tools: Red Lantern ring (energy constructs, flight, plasma vomit with durability negation, force fields), blood magic (precognition, portals, necromancy), rage empowerment/absorption/corruption, low-mid regeneration, heart-replacement immortality. Vulnerabilities: ring removal or calming can depower; entity possession risks control slippage.
World Breaker Hulk tools: Infinite strength/durability scaling with anger, rapid regeneration (high-mid combat, mid-high long-term), gamma radiation emission (planetary threat), super leaps, warrior-level tactics. Vulnerabilities: extreme calm reverts him to Banner (rare in WB state); holy or reality-warping counters exist but untested here.
Highest-impact swing factor: Atrocitus’ rage-manipulation hax versus Hulk’s regeneration economy—can the Butcher entity corrupt or feed on Hulk’s anger, or does the gamma aura simply overwhelm and outlast?

8. Hypothetical fight - step by step
A. Opening
Atrocitus seizes initiative with MFTL+ flight and immediate plasma vomit/construct barrage, aiming to corrode and corrupt. Hulk tanks the opening salvo, gamma aura flaring as rage builds; distance closes rapidly via leaps while Atrocitus maintains aerial zoning. Tempo favors Atrocitus early via speed and range.
B. Mid-fight
Hulk adapts by closing distance and landing thunderclaps that shatter constructs and generate shockwaves. Atrocitus’ blood magic and rage absorption begin feeding on Hulk’s escalating fury, potentially amplifying both combatants. Stamina and regeneration grow decisive; Hulk’s passive planetary radiation pressure forces Atrocitus into defensive rings while his own power ramps exponentially. Extended exchanges favor Hulk as durability and strength gap widens.
C. Turning points

Atrocitus lands corrosive plasma heart-strike—trigger: early speed blitz; beneficiary: Atrocitus (temporary power drain on Hulk); impact: brief stun but Hulk’s regen negates and angers him further.
Hulk’s gamma aura reaches planetary threat level—trigger: sustained rage; beneficiary: Hulk (environmental collapse forces Atrocitus groundward); impact: ring constructs strained, flight disrupted.
Butcher entity attempts full corruption—trigger: Hulk’s peak anger; beneficiary: potentially Atrocitus if successful, or Hulk if feedback amps him uncontrollably; impact: either quick win for Atrocitus or Hulk’s strength surges beyond entity limits.
Ring overload or calming attempt—trigger: Hulk’s thunderclap barrage; beneficiary: Hulk (ring instability); impact: depowers Atrocitus mid-flight, enabling finishing blows.

D. Source verdict evidence distribution

VS Battles Wiki scaling (derived, medium confidence): Atrocitus 2-C peak edges early via entity/Spectre feats; Hulk planetary+ but ramps to comparable. Slight Atrocitus edge ~5.5/10.
Comic Vine / Hulk Fandom feat aggregation (derived, high confidence): Hulk’s documented planet-busting clashes and regen outlast ring corrosion; Hulk 7/10.
Reddit respect threads & Quora debates (derived, medium confidence): Mixed but lean Hulk via infinite anger growth mirroring and surpassing ring mechanics; Hulk ~6.5-7/10.
Synthesis: Strong consensus on Hulk’s practical victory despite Atrocitus’ statistical speed/hax leads; no explicit source scores exist for this exact pairing.

9. Minority perspective
N/A: no materially distinct minority interpretation found beyond fringe hax-over-physical arguments already addressed in turning points; mainstream scaling leans Hulk.
10. Base verdict (always)
World Breaker Hulk wins 7/10. Under default random-encounter, bloodlusted assumptions with locked loadouts, Hulk’s superior strength ramp, planetary durability, and regeneration economy allow him to survive Atrocitus’ opening blitz, absorb escalating rage, and eventually overwhelm via raw physical dominance and gamma pressure. Atrocitus’ speed and entity hax secure the remaining 3/10 via early corruption or ring constructs, but evidence indicates Hulk prevails in prolonged combat.
11. Conditional verdict
N/A: outcome stable across tested assumptions.
12. Why stats and final verdict can diverge
N/A: linear profile and practical result align (Hulk’s physical category dominance directly translates to victory via regeneration and rage economy).
13. Closing
World Breaker Hulk stands as the superior combatant in this rage-fueled crossover clash, his limitless escalation and unbreakable regeneration proving decisive against Atrocitus’ formidable but ultimately outlasted arsenal. Confidence remains high on the base verdict given consistent feat scaling, though the key condition that could alter outcome remains Atrocitus successfully corrupting or depowering Hulk before the gamma ramp becomes unstoppable. In the end, the angriest being in the multiverse meets his match in the one who breaks worlds.
