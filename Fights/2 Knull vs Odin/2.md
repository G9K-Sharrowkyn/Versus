Theoretical Cosmological Evaluation: The Kinetic and Metaphysical Conflict Between the King in Black and the All-Father of Asgard
The intersection of primordial entropy and divine sovereignty represents one of the most volatile theoretical confrontations in the cosmological history of the Seventh Cosmos. To analyze the engagement between Knull, the Lord of the Abyss, wielding All-Black the Necrosword, and Odin Borson, the All-Father of Asgard, utilizing the Destroyer armor and the Oversword of Asgard, requires an examination that transcends mere physical statistics. This is a clash between the pre-existing vacuum of the non-existent "before" and the structured, ordered reality of the "now." Knull serves as the avatar of the void that predates the Big Bang, while Odin represents the pinnacle of the Skyfather hierarchy, a being capable of manipulating the fundamental forces of the multiverse to preserve the threads of existence.   

The Ontological Foundations of the Abyss: Knull and the First Symbiote
The entity known as Knull exists as a paradox within the Marvel Multiverse. He is a creature of the Abyss, a state of infinite darkness that reigned supreme before the Celestials introduced the "Light" of creation. This primordial status provides Knull with a fundamental advantage: he does not exist within the standard laws of life and death established by the cosmic abstracts. Instead, Knull possesses "amortality," a state of being that predates the concepts of mortality and immortality. When the Celestials began their work of terraforming the void into a structured universe, Knull viewed this as a personal violation of his kingdom. His reaction was the manifestation of the first symbiote from his own shadow, which he shaped into a blade of living darkness.   

The Genesis and Metaphysics of All-Black the Necrosword
All-Black the Necrosword is not a conventional weapon but a metaphysical extension of Knull’s own being. Its power was significantly augmented when Knull used the proto-symbiote to decapitate one of the early Celestials, an act that not only created the floating head known as Knowhere but also provided a forge for the blade’s refinement. By tempering the shadow-blade within the cosmic fires of a dying space god, Knull imbued the weapon with the ability to bypass the traditional invulnerability of divine beings. This established the Necrosword as the "Godslayer," a moniker it earned during Knull’s initial deicidal rampage across the nascent universe.   

Metaphysical Attribute	Knull / All-Black the Necrosword	Description and Significance
Origin Point	The Abyss (Pre-Creation)	
Exists outside the established timeline of the Seventh Cosmos.

Material Composition	Living Abyss / Proto-Symbiote	
A semi-sentient material capable of infinite shape-shifting and corruption.

Power Source	Celestial Necro-Energy	
Tethered to the decapitated head of a Celestial in the Realm Between.

Combat Concept	Entropy and Deicide	
Specifically designed to remove the "divine spark" from gods and cosmic entities.

Durability Tier	Amortal / Trans-Universal	
Survives black holes and the vacuum of space without biological requirements.

  
The Necrosword operates on a principle of corruption and consumption. It feeds on the blood of the gods it slays, growing more powerful with every deicidal act. This was evidenced during the tenure of Gorr the God Butcher, who utilized the blade to construct the "Godbomb," a device intended to propagate the symbiote’s darkness across all of time and space to erase every deity that ever existed. For Knull, the weapon is an infinite resource, a tool that allows him to slaughter entire pantheons with the same ease as a mortal harvesting wheat.   

Feats of the King in Black: A Track Record of Deicide
Knull’s historical performance against high-tier cosmic entities provides a benchmark for his combat potential. His most notable achievement remains the decapitation of a Celestial with a single strike, a feat that demonstrates a level of raw physical and metaphysical power that dwarfs most Skyfathers. Furthermore, during the King in Black event, Knull demonstrated his ability to:   

Overpower and rip the Sentry in half, a being often cited as having the power of a million exploding suns.   

Enslave and pilot the corpses of multiple Celestials, including Arishem the Judge, Jemiah the Analyzer, and Ziran the Tester, turning them into symbiotic puppets.   

Defeat the Silver Surfer in a direct duel, eventually corrupting him into the "Void Knight" before the Surfer was saved by Ego the Living Planet.   

Stab and overpower All-Father Thor, even while the latter was empowered by the full might of the Odinforce (renamed the Thorforce).   

These feats suggest that Knull operates at a level of existence that occupies the boundary between Skyfather entities and Abstract entities like Eternity or Death. While he has specific weaknesses—primarily to the "God of Light" or the Enigma Force—his base power level is consistently shown to be at or above the level of individual Celestials.   

The Sovereign Might of Asgard: Odin Borson and the Odinforce
Odin Borson, the All-Father of Asgard, represents the pinnacle of the Skyfather hierarchy. His power, the Odinforce, is a multiversal energy source that allows him to manipulate matter, energy, and the very fabric of reality. Odin’s feats are often described as galaxy-spanning; he has been shown shattering galaxies and reigniting dead stars as a mere side effect of his combat with entities like Seth.   

The Nature and Scope of the Odinforce
The Odinforce is the combined essence of Odin and his brothers, Vili and Ve, which Odin inherited upon their deaths. This power makes him a "master of the cosmic and mystical realms," capable of ending or creating entire multiverses. Unlike Knull, whose power is entropic and destructive, Odin’s power is often focused on the preservation of order and the maintenance of the World Tree, Yggdrasil.   

Odin’s most significant victory involves the defeat of the serpent-god Seth, a multiversal threat whose power was capable of threatening the roots of Yggdrasil. The World Tree itself is an infinite construct containing fully formed universes on infinite planes of reality, and Odin’s role as its guardian puts him in a tier of power that is rarely matched by mortal or minor divine beings.   

The Destroyer Armor: The Ultimate Asgardian Deterrent
Recognizing that the threat of the Celestials’ Fourth Host was too great for the Odinforce alone, Odin oversaw the construction of the Destroyer armor. This suit is not merely a piece of equipment but a deicidal vessel made of an unknown, enchanted metal that is superior to both primary Adamantium and Uru.   

Feature	The Destroyer Armor	Functional Specification
Material Strength	Beyond Adamantium/Uru	
Immune to almost all forms of physical and magical trauma.

Offensive Suite	Disintegrator Beams / Anti-Force	
Capable of reducing gods to their molecular components.

Power Integration	Life Force Absorption	
Channels the collective psyches of the entire Asgardian population.

Regeneration	Adaptive / Life-Based	
Can self-repair nearly instantly when in proximity to living beings.

Size Scaling	Variable / Celestial-Tier	
Capable of growing to match the 2,000-foot stature of the Celestials.

  
The Destroyer has demonstrated the ability to "no-sell" attacks from Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir, and has withstood the combined arcane power of Loki without taking damage. When activated by the All-Father and fueled by the life forces of Asgard, the Destroyer represents the absolute limit of Asgardian martial capability.   

The Odinsword: The Universe-Ending Catalyst
To complement the defensive capabilities of the Destroyer, Odin utilized the Oversword of Asgard, also known as the Odinsword. This weapon was forged from the cursed Rhinegold, which Odin reshaped into a blade of immense power. The Odinsword is a weapon of last resort; it is said that if the blade is ever fully drawn, "the end of the universe is at hand".   

During the conflict with the Fourth Host of Celestials, the Destroyer—piloted by Odin’s psyche and amped by the souls of Asgard—wielded the Odinsword to pierce the armor of Arishem the Judge. While the sword was capable of severing a Celestial's limb, it was ultimately unable to secure a permanent victory, as the Celestials’ regenerative abilities and collective power proved superior.   

Comparative Analysis: The Celestial Benchmark
The most effective method for scaling Knull against Odin in his Destroyer form is through their respective interactions with the Celestial race. The Celestials are the "gold standard" of cosmic power in the Marvel Universe, occupying a tier above typical Skyfathers and acting as the arbiters of existence.   

Odin’s Performance against the Fourth Host in Thor #300
The events of Thor #300 provide a definitive look at Odin’s limits. Even when inhabiting the Destroyer armor and wielding the Odinsword, Odin was decisively defeated by the Celestials.   

The Offensive Attempt: The Destroyer managed to slice off the arm of Nezarr the Celestial using the Odinsword.   

The Celestial Response: Nezarr regenerated his arm almost instantly. The Fourth Host then focused their combined energy into a single beam, melting the Destroyer armor into slag.   

The Conclusion of the Blade: After the Destroyer fell, Thor attempted to use the Odinsword against Arishem. Arishem analyzed the blade and then reduced it to molten slag with a single gesture.   

This battle established that even at his absolute martial peak—with the life force of his entire people fueling his armor—Odin is sub-Celestial in a direct confrontation with a Host.   

Knull’s Performance against the Celestials
Knull’s history is diametrically opposed to Odin’s when it comes to the Space Gods. While Odin struggled against the Fourth Host, Knull’s entire legend is built on his success in exterminating them.   

The First Beheading: Knull decapitated a Celestial with a single blow of All-Black.   

The Systematic Slaughter: Knull fought a war against the Celestials for eons, killing "countless" numbers of them.   

The Enslavement: During the King in Black invasion, Knull did not just fight Celestials; he enslaved them. He took control of Arishem, Ziran, Jemiah, and Eson (the latter of whom he killed), using them as frontline soldiers in his war against Earth.   

The transitive property of power scaling in this instance is stark. If a group of Celestials could easily destroy the Destroyer-Odin combination, and Knull can easily destroy or enslave those same Celestials, the disparity in power tiers becomes significant.   

Tactical Dynamics: The Necrosword vs. The Destroyer
In a direct engagement, the interaction between the Necrosword’s deicidal properties and the Destroyer’s enchanted composition would determine the outcome.

Ontological Erosion vs. Magical Durability
The Destroyer armor is designed to be physically and magically indestructible. It has withstood planet-shattering blasts and energy attacks from beings comparable to Odin himself. However, the Necrosword does not rely on simple kinetic force. It is an ontological eraser that functions by severing the metaphysical connection between a god and their divinity.   

Knull’s All-Black has the unique ability to "infect" what it touches. During the battle between Gorr and Thor, fragments of the sword that broke off became black maggots that burrowed into Thor’s flesh, continuing to corrupt him from within. If Knull were to strike the Destroyer armor, the blade might not need to shatter the shell instantly. Instead, it could initiate a process of symbiotic corruption, potentially infecting the Asgardian souls that provide the armor’s motive force.   

Energy Manipulation: The Odinforce vs. The Living Abyss
Odin’s energy projection via the Destroyer is formidable. He can unleash disintegrator beams and Anti-Force that can level mountain ranges or vaporize minor gods. Knull, however, commands the "Living Abyss"—a substance that absorbs light and energy. Knull has demonstrated the ability to smother stars and neutralize the Power Cosmic, which is often considered the baseline for universal-tier energy.   

Combat Category	Odin (Destroyer / Odinsword)	Knull (All-Black / Abyss)
Physical Strength	
Galaxy-tier; can grow to 2,000 ft.

Abstract-tier; can decapitate Celestials.

Regeneration	
Near-instant near life/magic.

Near-instant; amortality-based.

Offensive Range	
Universal (via Odinsword prophecy).

Multiversal (via Godbomb/Shadow-tendrils).

Corruption Capacity	
Minimal (primarily defensive magic).

Total (symbiotic infection of gods/beings).

Telepathic Resistance	
Skyfather-tier (stalemated Galactus).

Hive-mind tier (controls billions of symbiotes).

  
Knull’s ability to manipulate the Abyss allows him to create semi-sentient constructs known as Black Berserkers, which can swarm and distract an opponent. While the Destroyer’s disintegrator beams would likely incinerate these constructs with ease, the sheer volume of Knull’s swarm—combined with his own physical power—would place the All-Father under constant, multifaceted pressure.   

Metaphysical Vulnerabilities and the Light Variable
The most significant factor in any confrontation involving Knull is his specific weakness to "The Light." This is not merely the absence of darkness but a cosmic force known as the Enigma Force or the Uni-Power.   

The Enigma Force: The Antagonist of the Abyss
Knull’s defeat at the hands of Eddie Brock was facilitated by the Uni-Power, which transformed Brock into Captain Universe. The Enigma Force is described as the "God of Light," a sentient force that has been at war with Knull since the dawn of the Seventh Cosmos. It represents the thriving, diverse life of the multiverse, which is the direct antithesis of Knull’s singular, empty void.   

Odin, while a being of immense light and power, does not naturally wield the Enigma Force. The Odinforce is a different category of energy—sovereignty magic—which is comparable to the Power Cosmic. While Odin could potentially use his mastery of enchantments to simulate or tap into the properties of stellar plasma (Knull’s secondary weakness), he lacks the inherent "anti-Abyss" properties that made Captain Universe so effective.   

The Sun and Stellar Plasma
Knull’s physical form was ultimately vaporized within the core of the Sun. This establishes a clear threshold: if Odin can generate energy equivalent to the core of a star and focus it entirely on Knull, he has a path to a temporary victory. However, Knull has also survived being blasted by Celestials and falling through planetary atmospheres while engaged in combat. His regeneration is so potent that even after his jaw was smashed off by a "pissed off" King Thor, he reformed it almost instantly, laughing at the attempt.   

The Role of the Odinsword and the Rhinegold Curse
The Odinsword’s history as a weapon forged from the Rhinegold introduces a unique tactical liability for Odin. The Rhinegold is inherently cursed, and this curse manifested in the sword’s tendency to will itself from its sheath whenever Ragnarok approached. Knull is a being of entropy and shadow, and his All-Black Necrosword is the ultimate manifestation of deicidal darkness.   

There is a theoretical second-order insight to be found here: Knull might be able to "command" the curse of the Odinsword. Since the sword is a physical object carrying an entropic burden, Knull’s mastery over the Abyss might allow him to turn the weapon’s own prophecy against its wielder. If Knull can infect the blade with symbiotic darkness—as he did with the Silver Surfer’s board—he could effectively disarm Odin of his greatest weapon or, worse, use it to fulfill the prophecy of universal destruction under his own terms.   

Comparative Combat Intellect and Experience
Both Knull and Odin are ancient strategists with eons of experience in cosmic warfare.

Odin’s Strategic Mastery
Odin is a master of the "long game." He orchestrated the events leading to the Fourth Host’s arrival for centuries, preparing the Destroyer and the Odinsword as a final gamble for Earth’s safety. He has faced and defeated beings like Surtur, whose power threatens the entirety of the Nine Realms. Odin’s combat style is structured, utilizing his vast arcane knowledge and the collective power of Asgard to find an opponent’s weakness.   

Knull’s Primal Nihilism
Knull’s combat approach is more primal and overwhelming. He does not seek to "win" a duel so much as he seeks to extinguish a spark. His strategy involves overwhelming an opponent with the Living Abyss, corrupting their allies through the symbiote hive, and then finishing them with a single, deicidal strike of the Necrosword. Knull’s greatest advantage is his lack of concern for collateral damage; while Odin must protect his people and the universe, Knull thrives in the wreckage.   

The Hive-Mind vs. The Asgardian Unity
In a battle where Odin uses the Destroyer armor, he is utilizing the "Unity" of Asgard—the collective life force of his people. Knull is the "King in Black," the central node of a galaxy-spanning hive-mind of symbiotes.   

This creates a clash of two different types of collective consciousness.

The Asgardian Unity: It is a heroic, magical bond based on loyalty and the preservation of the All-Father. Its weakness is the physical limit of the souls involved; they cannot stay in the Destroyer indefinitely without burning out.   

The Symbiote Hive: It is a forced, parasitic bond based on Knull’s absolute will. Its strength is its resilience; even if Knull is incapacitated, the hive remains, and the Necrosword can act on its own to seek a new host or protect its creator.   

If Knull can use All-Black to penetrate the Destroyer armor—even slightly—he can introduce a symbiotic infection into the collective Asgardian psyche. This would not just damage the armor; it would potentially turn the entire population of Asgard into Knull’s thralls, effectively ending the battle by turning Odin’s own power source against him.   

The Physics of the Void and the Odinforce
Odin’s power is derived from the "Light" of creation, even if it is channeled through the darker, more sovereign aspects of the Odinforce. Knull is the void that existed before that light was born. In many ways, the Odinforce is a "fire" that requires the "fuel" of existence—stars, souls, and the World Tree—to function.   

Knull is the absence of fuel. He is the cold, empty space that remains when the fire goes out. This fundamental difference means that while Odin can strike Knull with the "fire" of the Odinforce, Knull is essentially designed to absorb and smother that fire. This was seen during his battle with the Silver Surfer, where the Surfer had to expend his entire Power Cosmic—the background radiation of the universe—to merely "blast" Knull away, failing to kill him.   

Tactical Simulations: Environment and Stakes
The outcome of this duel would vary depending on the location and the preparation available to each side.

Scenario A: The Dark Abyss
If the battle takes place in the empty space between galaxies—Knull’s home territory—the King in Black holds every advantage. The lack of external "Light" and life-energy would weaken the Destroyer’s regenerative enchantments, which require a proximity to life to function optimally. In this environment, Knull could summon his symbiote dragons and Black Berserkers to swarm the Destroyer, slowly eroding its defenses until he can deliver a killing blow with the Necrosword.   

Scenario B: The Golden Realm of Asgard
If Knull invades Asgard, Odin has a significant home-field advantage. The proximity to Yggdrasil and the life force of the Nine Realms would supercharge the Destroyer’s regenerative systems. Furthermore, Asgard is filled with ancient, magical artifacts that Odin could use to supplement the Destroyer’s power. However, this also increases the stakes; a single slip-up by Odin could lead to the infection and destruction of his entire kingdom.   

Dimensional Scaling: Yggdrasil vs. The Cosmos
Odin’s status as a multiversal entity is often tied to his relationship with Yggdrasil, which contains infinite universes. Knull’s power is often cited as being "above Celestial" but not necessarily multiversal in the sense of creating or destroying infinite timelines with a thought.   

However, Knull’s impact on the multiverse is entropic. His Godbomb was a multiversal threat that reached through time to kill every god in every universe. His invasion of Earth during King in Black was treated as a threat to the entire cosmological order, requiring the intervention of the Enigma Force—the multiverse’s own immune system.   

Entity	Scaling Basis	Peak Dimensional Feat
Odin	Yggdrasil / World Tree	
Defeated Seth, who threatened infinite universes.

Knull	The Abyss / Pre-Universal	
Decapitated a Celestial; threatened the entire multiverse via Godbomb.

  
In a vacuum, Odin’s "ordered" multiversal power might seem superior. But Knull represents a "hole" in that order. He is a piece of the prior multiverse that survived into the current one, making him an anomaly that the standard laws of Skyfather-tier magic struggle to account for.   

The Resilience of the Destroyer: A Potential Stalemate?
While the Celestials managed to melt the Destroyer, it is important to note that it required the combined offensive of the Fourth Host. A single Celestial might not have been able to achieve this. Knull, however, is a "single" entity who possesses the power of multiple Celestials.   

If Odin can keep the battle at a distance, using the Destroyer’s disintegrator beams to keep Knull from closing in with the Necrosword, he could potentially reach a stalemate. Knull’s regenerative factor and amortality would prevent Odin from killing him, but the Destroyer’s own regeneration and durability might keep Odin from being destroyed. This would become a battle of endurance—and as previously noted, Odin’s "fuel" (the Asgardian souls) is finite, while Knull’s "void" is infinite.   

Final Synthesis: The Hierarchical Conclusion
When evaluating the confrontation between Knull with All-Black and Odin with the Destroyer armor and Odinsword, the consensus across historical records and combat simulations favors the King in Black.   

The reasoning for this verdict is anchored in three primary ontological truths:

The Celestial Power Floor: Knull operates at a tier where he can decapitate and enslave Celestials—entities that represent the absolute limit of Odin’s martial capability. If Odin’s ultimate form (the amped Destroyer) was defeated by the Fourth Host, and Knull is the superior to that same Host, the outcome is statistically inevitable.   

The Specificity of the Godslayer: All-Black the Necrosword is a specialized instrument of deicide. Its entire metaphysical purpose is to exploit the vulnerabilities of divine beings like Odin. While Odin is a god of supreme power, he is still a "God" within the context of the Necrosword’s targets.   

The Entropy Advantage: Odin represents the peak of a structured universe. Knull represents the void that precedes and succeeds it. In a war of attrition, the void always wins, as it does not require food, sleep, or a stable timeline to exist.   

While Odin is perhaps the most formidable Skyfather to ever draw a blade, he is ultimately a part of the "Creation" that Knull was born to undo. Without the specific intervention of the Enigma Force—the only energy source truly designed to combat the Abyss—Odin would likely fall, his soul and the souls of Asgard becoming another layer of necro-energy for the King in Black’s ever-growing hive.   

Strategic Counter-Narrative: Odin’s Path to Victory
Despite the overwhelming odds, Odin Borson is the "God of Wisdom." If there is a path to victory, he would find it through the following tactical maneuvers:

Star-Fire Concentration: By funneling the entire Odinforce into the Destroyer’s visor, Odin could create a beam of solar-intensity plasma that exceeds the heat of a supernova. This is the only physical force shown to reliably incapacitate Knull.   

The Sacrifice Play: Odin could potentially "overload" the Odinsword. If the blade is truly a universal detonator, Odin could threaten to destroy the entire universe to take Knull with him. While Knull might survive in some form, his physical host and his plan would be erased.   

Enchantment of the Void: Odin has the power to place permanent enchantments on items and entities. He could potentially attempt to "re-bind" Knull to the Abyss, using a modified version of the enchantments that once kept the Destroyer trapped in its temple.   

However, these maneuvers are high-risk and low-probability. Knull’s history of overcoming the Silver Surfer, the Sentry, and All-Father Thor suggests that his place in the cosmic hierarchy is simply a tier above the Skyfathers of Asgard. In the dark history of the Seventh Cosmos, the King in Black remains the ultimate shadow, a predator that even the All-Father’s light cannot permanently banish.
