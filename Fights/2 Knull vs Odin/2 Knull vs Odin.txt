Template Summary:
- headline: FINAL SUMMARY
- subtitle:
- winner: Statistical draw, slight edge Knull
- line_1: Overall averages are inside draw threshold (<1), Knull 90.97 vs Odin 91.06.
- line_2: Knull is better in long wars. Odin is better if he keeps light control through the whole fight.
- line_3: Not all scenarios are equally likely; broken light control is more common, so the overall lean stays slightly with Knull.

Template Battle Dynamics:

- b_curve: 74,82,88,81,75
- yellow_wave: 35,38,34,39,33,37,35,38
- phase_1: Knull takes early initiative through swarm pressure and pace.
- phase_2: Odin stabilizes with spacing, control tools, and counter windows.
- phase_3: Attrition and resource economy decide late-fight direction.
- analysis: Knull wins long damage loops. Odin wins controlled counter windows.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: How the fight changes with light control
- opening: Knull starts with direct rush pressure, swarm volume, and close-range entries.
- mid_fight: Odin shifts to controlled spacing, kite lanes, and high-value counter bursts.
- late_fight: Fight collapses into heavy exchanges where resource economy decides.
- end_condition: Sustained light suppression favors Odin; broken control loops favor Knull attrition.

- subtitle: Condition-dependent outcomes
- col_left: LIGHT CONTROL: SUSTAINED
- col_right: LIGHT CONTROL: DISRUPTED
- row_top: STANDARD KO/BFR/INCAP
- row_bottom: KILL-ONLY DEATHMATCH
- case_1: Odin 6.5/10. If light-control uptime is sustained through most phases, Odin converts safer with spacing and Destroyer durability.
- case_2: Knull 6.5/10. If light control is disrupted, Knull closes distance and recovers value through regen loops.
- case_3: Odin 5.5/10. Sustained control still helps, but kill-only raises finish requirements and attrition risk.
- case_4: Knull 7/10. Disrupted control in kill-only most strongly favors Necrosword attrition and endurance economy.
