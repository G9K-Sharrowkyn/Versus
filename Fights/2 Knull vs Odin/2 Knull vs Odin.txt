Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Why a baseline draw still needs scenario logic
- line_1: Average gap is below 1 point, so parameter baseline is a draw.
- line_2: Knull gains in long regen attrition; Odin gains with sustained light-control execution.
- line_3: Final favorite must be selected by conditions, not by raw table values.
- quote: Paper parity moves the verdict to conditions.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Near draw averages can hide hard-counter pathways
- trap_top: PAPER PARITY
- trap_bottom: CONDITIONAL OUTCOME SHIFT
- example: One stable counter interaction can outweigh small category leads.
- question: Who controls the fight condition before resources fall off?

- b_value: 50
- b_bonus: 12
- regen: COUNTER
- mechanika: Knull gains value as damage is reset; Odin gains value by sustained light suppression.
- implikacja: Short controlled exchanges help Odin, extended exchanges help Knull.
- psychologia: Failed finish attempts increase pressure on the side with lower recovery economy.

Template Summary:
- headline: FINAL SUMMARY
- subtitle: Baseline plus conditional branches
- winner: BASELINE DRAW (stats) | CONDITIONAL EDGE: KNULL 6/10 (4-source synthesis)
- line_1: Overall averages are inside draw threshold (<1), Knull 90.97 vs Odin 91.06.
- line_2: Knull leads attrition; Odin leads tactical conversion when light-control uptime is sustained.
- line_3: Matrix is weighted, not 50/50; sustained control is rarer than disrupted control, so baseline remains slightly pro-Knull.

Template Battle Dynamics:
- headline: BATTLE DYNAMICS
- subtitle: Momentum shifts across phases
- a_curve: 90,84,76,82,88
- b_curve: 74,82,88,81,75
- yellow_wave: 35,38,34,39,33,37,35,38
- phase_1: Knull takes early initiative through swarm pressure and pace.
- phase_2: Odin stabilizes with spacing, control tools, and counter windows.
- phase_3: Attrition and resource economy decide late-fight direction.
- analysis: Knull wins long damage loops. Odin wins controlled counter windows.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: Branching fight logic by condition
- opening: Knull starts with direct rush pressure, swarm volume, and close-range entries.
- mid_fight: Odin shifts to controlled spacing, kite lanes, and high-value counter bursts.
- late_fight: Fight collapses into heavy exchanges where resource economy decides.
- end_condition: Sustained light suppression favors Odin; broken control loops favor Knull attrition.

Template Verdict Matrix:

- subtitle: Condition-dependent outcomes
- col_left: LIGHT CONTROL: SUSTAINED
- col_right: LIGHT CONTROL: DISRUPTED
- row_top: STANDARD KO/BFR/INCAP
- row_bottom: KILL-ONLY DEATHMATCH
- case_1: Odin 6.5/10. If light-control uptime is sustained through most phases, Odin converts safer with spacing and Destroyer durability.
- case_2: Knull 6.5/10. If light control is disrupted, Knull closes distance and recovers value through regen loops.
- case_3: Odin 5.5/10. Sustained control still helps, but kill-only raises finish requirements and attrition risk.
- case_4: Knull 7/10. Disrupted control in kill-only most strongly favors Necrosword attrition and endurance economy.
