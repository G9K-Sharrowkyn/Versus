Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Who wins the fight on paper?
- line_1: Ali wins the paper fight because his biggest advantages are the ones that end human fights.
- line_2: Lee is faster and more varied, but he has to solve mass, reach, and clinch weight at the same time.
- line_3: This matchup changes in margin more than in winner identity.
- quote: Lee has better tools for chaos. Ali has better tools for a real fight.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Why better stats do not guarantee victory
- trap_top: BETTER SPEED OR STYLE >
- trap_bottom: CAN STILL LOSE TO MASS, REACH, AND CHIN
- example: A faster, more varied fighter can still lose if every clean counter from the bigger man changes the fight more.
- question: Can Lee keep the fight off Ali's jab line long enough to matter?

Template Summary:
- headline: FINAL SUMMARY
- subtitle:
- winner: Ali by size and ring reality
- line_1: Stat average favors Ali, 87.7 vs 78.9.
- line_2: Open rules give Lee more tools, but boxing rules widen Ali's edge even further.
- line_3: The margin changes with rules. The winner does not.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: One winner, two different levels of difficulty
- opening: Ali sets range with the jab while Lee tries to enter off angles and low kicks.
- mid_fight: Once the distance compresses, Ali's weight, clinch control, and durability become harder to tax.
- late_fight: If Lee has not already slowed the lead leg, Ali's clean counters and physical pressure take over.
- end_condition: Lee needs a near-perfect mobility game. Ali can win by making the same entry cost too much every time.

- b_curve: 68,72,77,82,87
- yellow_wave: 24,29,27,30,26,31,25,29
- phase_1: Lee is quickest when the fight is still about entry and surprise.
- phase_2: Ali gets stronger as the fight becomes about range, jab discipline, and clinch control.
- phase_3: If the leg-kick route fails to change the map, Ali's finish routes take over.
- analysis: Open rules help Lee more than boxing does. They still do not erase Ali's size and tested durability.
