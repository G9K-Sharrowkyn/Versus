Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Who wins the fight on paper?
- line_1: Vader is the cleaner technician, faster thinker, and better pure fighter.
- line_2: Thanos still wins the paper fight because Vader's offense does not scale to his durability.
- line_3: When one side can survive the other side's best tools, technique stops being the deciding stat.
- quote: Vader needs a perfect opener. Thanos only needs to stay alive through it.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Why better stats do not guarantee victory
- trap_top: BETTER TECHNIQUE >
- trap_bottom: CAN'T FIX A COSMIC DURABILITY GAP
- example: A higher skill score means little if the opponent can ignore your best hit and answer with one clean finish.
- question: Can Vader create a real kill path before the durability wall closes the fight?
