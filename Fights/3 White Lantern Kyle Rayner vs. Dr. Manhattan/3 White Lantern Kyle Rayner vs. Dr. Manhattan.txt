Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Who wins the fight on paper?
- line_1: Kyle wins the paper comparison through speed, skill, and a broader active toolkit.
- line_2: Manhattan still leads because he can strike before Kyle fully builds his win condition.
- line_3: This is the cleanest example of better stats not guaranteeing the default winner.
- quote: Kyle has the better profile. Manhattan has the better first move.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Why better stats do not guarantee victory
- trap_top: BETTER PAPER PROFILE >
- trap_bottom: SLOWER FIRST MOVE AGAINST PREEMPTION
- example: Kyle can look stronger on paper and still lose if his win condition needs setup time.
- question: Can Kyle force a rewrite window before Manhattan deletes the setup?

- mechanika: Kyle's best win condition needs manifestation time, while Manhattan's attacks the setup itself.
- implikacja: The fight flips only if Kyle gets a real window to force metaphysical overwrite.
- psychologia: If Manhattan waits, Kyle gets room to act. If Manhattan moves first, Kyle may never get started.

Template Summary:

- subtitle:
- winner: Kyle wins the stats, Manhattan leads the fight
- line_1: Stat average favors Kyle, 88.1 vs 83.3.
- line_2: Manhattan still leads because he can act before Kyle fully brings his best win condition online.
- line_3: Kyle only turns it around when the Life Equation is full and Manhattan does not move first.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: How the fight changes if Manhattan moves first
- opening: Kyle opens with speed, layered constructs, and immediate pressure.
- mid_fight: Manhattan attacks the ring source or the timeline of the move instead of trading cleanly.
- late_fight: If Manhattan delays, Kyle can force a metaphysical rewrite window.
- end_condition: Stats favor Kyle. First-move control favors Manhattan.

- yellow_wave: 42,48,41,46,43,49,40,47
- phase_1: Manhattan controls the first meaningful move.
- phase_2: Kyle is dangerous only if he buys a real rewrite window.
- phase_3: Passive Manhattan creates the only branch that flips the fight.
- analysis: If Manhattan acts first, the fight stays one-sided. If he waits, Kyle's line spikes fast.

Template Verdict Matrix:
- headline: VERDICT MATRIX
- subtitle: Two things that decide the fight
- col_left: LIFE EQUATION: FULL
- col_right: LIFE EQUATION: LIMITED
- row_top: MANHATTAN: PROACTIVE
- row_bottom: MANHATTAN: PASSIVE
- case_1: Dr. Manhattan 6.5/10. Full rewrite access helps Kyle, but proactive preemption still steals most openings.
- case_2: Dr. Manhattan 9/10. Limited metaphysical access plus ring dependence gives Manhattan the cleanest finish route.
- case_3: Kyle 7/10. If Manhattan waits, full Life Equation access creates the one branch where Kyle can rewrite the fight.
- case_4: Dr. Manhattan 6.5/10. Passive behavior narrows the gap, but limited White Lantern output still leaves Manhattan favored.
