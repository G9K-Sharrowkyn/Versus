Template Interpretation:
- headline: INTERPRETATION
- subtitle: Who wins the fight on paper?
- line_1: Galactus wins the paper fight through scale, durability, and broader cosmic control.
- line_2: Trigon is still dangerous because his best win routes attack the mind and the battlefield itself, not just toughness.
- line_3: Galactus leads the normal fight, but hunger and realm control can still change the result.
- quote: Trigon wants a corrupted world. Galactus wants a usable fuel source.

Template Stat Trap:
- headline: STAT TRAP
- subtitle: Why better stats do not guarantee victory
- trap_top: BETTER HAX OR HOME TURF >
- trap_bottom: CAN STILL LOSE IF THE ENEMY EATS THE FUEL
- example: A realm advantage stops mattering if the other side can convert the realm into power.
- question: Does Trigon lock the fight first, or does Galactus turn the field into food?

Template Summary:
- headline: FINAL SUMMARY
- subtitle:
- winner: Galactus leads, but Trigon can still turn it around
- line_1: Stat average favors Galactus, 92.7 vs 87.3.
- line_2: On neutral ground, Galactus still leads because Power Cosmic stays reliable longer.
- line_3: Trigon flips the fight whenever hunger enters the equation, and his best branch is hunger plus home-realm control.

Template Fight Simulation:
- headline: FIGHT SIMULATION // THREE PHASE MODEL
- subtitle: How hunger and battlefield control change the fight
- opening: Trigon opens with portals, corruption, and soul pressure while Galactus stabilizes the field with barriers and cosmic awareness.
- mid_fight: If the first hax window fails, Galactus shifts the fight from damage trading to energy conversion.
- late_fight: Battlefield and feeding state decide whether Trigon keeps a hax zone or becomes fuel for a larger cosmic response.
- end_condition: Trigon needs an early systemic lock. Galactus wants the fight to last long enough to change what the field means.

- b_curve: 72,76,81,86,90
- yellow_wave: 41,46,42,47,43,48,44,46
- phase_1: Trigon has live first windows because his best attacks target the rules of the fight.
- phase_2: Once Galactus proves the energy is consumable, the whole matchup tilts.
- phase_3: A corrupted realm helps Trigon only as long as it stays hostile instead of edible.
- analysis: Trigon is dangerous early and at home. Galactus is more reliable everywhere else.

Template Verdict Matrix:
- headline: VERDICT MATRIX
- subtitle: Two things that change the winner
- col_left: BATTLEFIELD: NEUTRAL
- col_right: BATTLEFIELD: TRIGON REALM
- row_top: GALACTUS: WELL-FED
- row_bottom: GALACTUS: STARVING
- case_1: Galactus 8/10. Neutral space plus a full tank gives him the cleanest route to absorb and overwhelm.
- case_2: Galactus 6.5/10. Trigon's realm creates better hax windows, but Galactus can still convert the field if he stabilizes.
- case_3: Trigon 6/10. A hungry Galactus loses the safest version of his energy economy even on neutral ground.
- case_4: Trigon 7.5/10. Starvation plus home-realm control is the best realistic branch for Trigon to close first.
