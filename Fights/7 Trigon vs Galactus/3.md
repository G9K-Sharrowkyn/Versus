Key Points

Research from comic databases and versus debates suggests Galactus wins through versatile Power Cosmic manipulation that counters Trigon's demonic mysticism on a cosmic scale.
Trigon brings strong regeneration, soul control, and reality-altering hax, creating intense early pressure, but the evidence leans toward Galactus prevailing in most neutral scenarios.
The matchup favors Galactus with an 8/10 score under default assumptions, though outcomes hinge on battlefield and feeding status in edge cases.

Character Overviews
Trigon, a demonic conqueror spawned from cosmic evil, relies on overwhelming mystical force, possession, and multiversal conquest tactics. His prime form maximizes soul absorption and dimensional dominance. Galactus, the survivor of a prior universe empowered by the Power Cosmic, operates as an abstract entity focused on planetary sustenance and universal balance. His prime (well-fed) state unlocks godlike energy projection and matter restructuring.

0. Hook
In a clash of cosmic horror and universal hunger, Trigon (Prime Earth)—the demon who devoured evils across galaxies and conquered dimensions—faces Galactus (Earth-616), the devourer of worlds armed with the near-limitless Power Cosmic. Raw mystical domination meets abstract energy mastery: will Trigon's soul-shattering reality warps overwhelm the cosmic entity, or will Galactus's godlike scale and adaptability consume even a lord of darkness? This analysis merges feats, scaling, and debates into one coherent verdict, revealing how non-linear combat realities often override linear stat comparisons.
1. Introduction and methodology
This VS writeup synthesizes data from primary comic wikis (DC and Marvel Databases), respect threads, versus debate forums (ComicVine, Reddit powerscaling), and scaling resources. Nine standardized combat categories were used: Strength, Speed, Durability, Combat IQ, Hax, Stamina, Fighting Style, Experience, and Combat Skills. Evidence from defeated opponents, specific feats, and context was mapped per source, then averaged arithmetically (rounded to whole numbers). Fights are acknowledged as non-linear—hax interactions, battlefield, and win conditions can diverge from raw stats.
2. Character introduction
2.A Trigon (Prime Earth)
Prime Earth Trigon is a unique demonic celestial conqueror born from the Divine's failed attempt to purge evil via the Heart of Darkness. He absorbed evils from nearly 100 galaxies, gaining near-limitless power that intimidates even the Quintessence. Strongest practical edges: soul manipulation, possession/mind control, hellfire/pyrokinesis, regeneration, dimensional travel/portals, molecular reconstruction, telekinesis/telepathy, and reality alteration on planetary-to-multiversal scales in lore. Style: overwhelming brute mystical force paired with corruption and domination; mentality is tyrannical ruler seeking total subjugation.
2.B Galactus (Earth-616)
Earth-616 Galactus (Galan) is the sole survivor of the prior universe, merged with the Sentience of the Cosmos and sustained by the Power Cosmic. In prime/well-fed state, he wields immeasurable godlike abilities. Strongest practical edges: energy projection/absorption (galaxy-threatening), matter transmutation/restructuring, size alteration (galaxy-scale), cosmic awareness, force fields, teleportation, soul/emotion manipulation, and resurrection. Style: abstract cosmic force operating on universal balance; mentality is neither hero nor villain but necessary devourer.
3. Averaged stats table

Category Trigon (Prime Earth) /Galactus (Earth-616)
Strength 83/96
Speed 85/95
Durability 88/97
Combat IQ 82/93
Hax 90/97
Stamina 90/94
Fighting Style 75/88
Experience 94/97
Combat Skills 78/89
Overall Average 85/94
One short on-paper interpretation: Galactus leads in 8 of 9 categories with a 9-point overall edge, driven by cosmic-scale hax and durability; Trigon remains competitive in experience and specialized mystical hax but lacks the raw versatility to close the gap consistently.
4. Origin and profile
Trigon originated as a planetary ruler who consumed the Heart of Darkness and galactic evils, killing his creators (the Divine) and wearing their flesh before conquering dimensions and siring demonic offspring to spread corruption. His philosophy is pure domination: evil as the natural order, with Earth/Raven as keys to multiversal rule. Combat mentality is arrogant overlord who possesses or crushes resistance. Galactus survived the Big Bang's precursor as Galan, merging with cosmic sentience after his universe's death. He maintains universal balance by devouring planets, viewing himself as neither evil nor good but essential. Profile: detached cosmic judge who appoints heralds and rarely engages personally unless starved or challenged at scale. Comparison: Trigon's personal tyranny contrasts Galactus's impersonal inevitability; the demon seeks conquest through corruption, while the entity enforces entropy through consumption.
5. Powers and weaknesses
Trigon key tools: Eldritch blasts/hellfire, dimensional portals/summoning, mind control/possession (hundreds including Teen Titans), telekinesis (flings Superboy-level foes), molecular reconstruction/disintegration, illusions, regeneration (from heart extraction/death), immortality, soul absorption (billions). Vulnerabilities: holy ground (ignites), high-tier magic resistance limits, physical invulnerability pierced by razor-sharp magical weapons.
Galactus key tools: Power Cosmic grants energy blasts (solar system/galaxy scale), matter/energy transmutation (lead to water, restructure planets), size alteration, cosmic awareness/teleportation, force fields, soul manipulation, resurrection. Vulnerabilities: starvation weakens him dramatically (prime locks well-fed), susceptible to specific artifacts (e.g., Ultimate Nullifier) or magic in rare cases.
Highest-impact swing factor: Galactus's energy absorption and matter manipulation can neutralize Trigon's hellfire/soul hax while his cosmic awareness resists possession—potentially turning Trigon's greatest offensive tools into sustenance.

7. Complete defeated/neutralized list
Trigon: The Divine (parents/cosmic beings), legions of Hell, Teen Titans (possessed/stomped), Justice League equivalents in team battles, various demonic rulers and planetary populations across conquered dimensions (no duplicates).
Galactus: Mad Celestials (one destroyed while powered), Proemial Gods elements/Annihilation Wave forces, countless planetary civilizations and defenders (e.g., Archeopia, Tarnax IV), herald rebels (imprisoned/dismissed), multiple star systems indirectly via blasts.
8. Hypothetical fight - step by step
8.1 Opening
First-contact dynamics favor Galactus controlling tempo and distance via cosmic awareness and warp-speed flight. Trigon opens with eldritch eye blasts, hellfire, and immediate possession/mind-control attempts or portal summoning. Galactus counters instantly with energy absorption (potentially feeding on Trigon's blasts) and matter-restructuring force fields, seizing initiative while Trigon relies on brute mystical pressure.
8.2 Mid-fight
Adaptation phase elevates Galactus's matter transmutation and size alteration as Trigon's possession fails against cosmic resistance. Stamina drain and regen loops grow critical—Trigon regenerates but Galactus absorbs ambient energy. Extended exchanges favor Galactus as his versatility grows, draining Trigon's necrotic empowerment while cosmic awareness reads and counters tactical shifts.
8.3 Turning points

Trigger: Trigon lands soul-absorption/possession—beneficiary: Trigon briefly (mind control edge), impact: temporary Galactus vulnerability until Power Cosmic purge (pro-Trigon branch).
Trigger: Galactus absorbs hellfire/mystical energy—beneficiary: Galactus (powers up), impact: amplifies blasts to galaxy scale, overwhelming Trigon's regeneration (pro-Galactus).
Trigger: Trigon portals to his realm for home advantage—beneficiary: Trigon (reality warp boost), impact: close call but Galactus teleports out or transmuted the environment.
Trigger: Prolonged fight starves Galactus (edge case)—beneficiary: Trigon, impact: shifts odds but prime assumptions prevent this.

8.4 Source verdict evidence distribution

DC Fandom + respect threads synthesis: Derived (high confidence) – Trigon strong but outscaled; Galactus implied superior via cosmic feats.
Marvel Fandom + scaling: Derived (high confidence) – Galactus wins via Power Cosmic versatility; ~8/10.
ComicVine debates: Derived (medium confidence) – "Full-power Galactus crushes Trigon" consensus; 7-8/10.
Reddit powerscales/YouTube analyses: Derived (medium confidence) – Galactus favored (Dormammu-comparable scaling edge); slight edge Galactus ~7.5/10.
Synthesis sentence: Strong consensus across sources for Galactus victory with high-confidence derivations aligning on scale advantage; no major outliers.

9. Minority perspective
N/A: no materially distinct minority interpretation found (debates occasionally favor Trigon in his realm or starved-Galactus variants, but these violate prime/default locks and lack credible scaling support).
10. Base verdict (always)
Galactus wins 8/10 under default neutral battlefield, standard prime loadouts, and bloodlusted/in-character assumptions. Rationale: Power Cosmic's energy absorption and matter manipulation directly counter Trigon's primary tools while superior durability and cosmic awareness prevent successful possession or reality-warping loops; Trigon forces a high-diff fight but cannot overcome the tier gap.
11. Conditional verdict
N/A: outcome stable across tested assumptions.
12. Why stats and final verdict can diverge
N/A: linear profile and practical result align.
13. Closing
Galactus stands as the clear victor in this prime matchup, his Power Cosmic proving too versatile and vast for even Trigon's galaxy-spanning demonic might. Confidence is high based on consistent comic scaling and debate consensus, with the key condition that could alter outcome being extreme starvation for Galactus or a realm-locked battlefield heavily favoring Trigon. Ultimately, the devourer of worlds consumes another threat to universal balance.
